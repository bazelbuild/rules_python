A rule for building Python Wheels.

Wheels are Python distribution format defined in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/.

This rule packages a set of targets into a single wheel.

Currently only pure-python wheels are supported.

Examples:

```python
# Package some specific py_library targets, without their dependencies
py_wheel(
    name = "minimal_with_py_library",
    # Package data. We're building "example_minimal_library-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"

    python_tag = "py3",
    version = "0.0.1",
    deps = [
        "//examples/wheel/lib:module_with_data",
        "//examples/wheel/lib:simple_module",
    ],
)

# Use py_package to collect all transitive dependencies of a target,
# selecting just the files within a specific python package.
py_package(
    name = "example_pkg",
    # Only include these Python packages.
    packages = ["examples.wheel"],
