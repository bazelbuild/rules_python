# Python Rules Proposals

This is an index of all design documents and proposals for Python rules, both in native code (the Bazel binary) and in Starlark (the rules_python repository). Some of these proposals are also hosted in this directory.

Proposals that impact native code are also indexed by [bazelbuild/proposals](https://github.com/bazelbuild/proposals), and subject to the [Bazel design process](https://bazel.build/designs/index.html).
